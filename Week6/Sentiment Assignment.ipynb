    "### Questions\n",

    "Q: Overall, which artist has the higher average sentiment per song? \n",
    "\n",
    "A: Based on our score metric, The Beatles had a slight edge in average sentiment at 0.052049 compared to Led Zeppelin's score of 0.040518.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: For your first artist, what are the three songs that have the highest and lowest sentiments? Print the lyrics of those songs to the screen. What do you think is driving the sentiment score? \n",
    "\n",
    "A: For the Beatles, the top three highest sentiment songs in order from least to most positive were: \"Till There was You\", \"Chains\", and \"Love Me Do.\" Looking at the lyrics, it is pretty clear that these are all love songs, as words such as 'love', 'sweet', and 'baby' appear numerous times throughout the songs. Their lowest sentiment songs in order least to most negative: \"All I've Got to Do\", \"Don't Bother Me\", and \"Misery.\" \"All I've Got to Do\", doesn't appear too negative. Given the lyrics it looks like the singer is happy with the relationship with his parter. However, the score is very close to zero, so it is probably more of a neutral/happy song that was misinterpreted by the lexicon based approach. The other two songs are very clearly breakup songs and the singer is very upset, 'misery', 'leave', and 'bother' all indicate the singer is sad and wants to be left alone.\n",

    "Q: For your second artist, what are the three songs that have the highest and lowest sentiments? Print the lyrics of those songs to the screen. What do you think is driving the sentiment score? \n",
    "\n",
    "A: Led Zeppelin's highest sentiment song in order from least to most positive were: \"Living Loving Maid\", \"Celebration Day\", and \"Whole Lotta Love\". In the first and thrid songs, 'love', 'baby' and 'loving' are repeated many times, likely leading to higher scores. In \"Celebration Day\", the singer sings about being happy, dancing, cheering, etc. which is driving the positive sentiment. Led Zepellin's lowest sentiment songs in order from least to most negative were: \"Since I've Been Loving You\", \"Communication Breakdown\", and \"Your Time is Gonna Come.\" \"Since I've Been Loving You\", actually had a positive score but was very close to neutral. My guess is that the repeated use of 'love' throughout' the song artifically bumped the score up, because the rest of the song he sings about crying and his life being a drag. 'Communication Breakdown' looks like it's about the singer not being able to properly talk to a girl he likes. So, it isn't completely negative, but repeating words like 'nervous' and 'breakdown' definitely drive down the score. All one has to do to understand why \"Your Time is Gonna Come\" is negative is read the first three words: \"Lying, cheating, hurting.\" This song is about the singer getting cheated on and is full of resentful/negative words, so no surprise it was the lowest song.\n",

    "\n",
    "See plot above. The Beatles distribution was much more spread out, but consistently positive. While Led Zeppelin's distribution was concentrated at slightly positive to neutral. This may indicate that they toe the line between positive/negative in songs, or they're using words in a context that the lexicon-based approach can't capture. I can think of a lot of negative Led Zeppelin songs, so I think it may be the latter, and they also use 'love' and 'baby' a lot. It could also just be our small sample size.\n",
