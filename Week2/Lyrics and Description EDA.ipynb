    "\n",
    "A: Assertion statements are good because they allow us to check our code within the function to make sure it is doing everything correctly. In our case, we used a simple list to ensure that our four metrics were calculating correctly. Since, it is fairly easy to calculate the metrics on the list, we can simply set the assertions to be equal to our hand-calculated metric. Then if everything runs without error, we know that we created our function and calculations correctly. "

    "Since stop words are some of the common words, I'd expect our top five words to be mostly stopwords if we didn't remove them. So we'd get words like \"the\" and \"of\", since they are so necessary in the English language. This wouldn't be very helpful for an analysis however, since each of the corpora that we would evaluate would return same stopwords. \n",

    "My prior belief was that Led Zeppelin would be higher. The Beatles have more pop-influences which consist of shorter songs with a lot of choruses. Many Led Zeppelin songs don't repeat choruses, so I figured this could lead to a higher lexical diversity. However, I did think that Led Zeppelin may be disadvantaged for having longer songs, as I know they have some fairly long ones. Having a longer document can artifically lower lexical diversity calculated by Type-Token Ratio, since the author may have to repeat several function words. Although we did remove stopwords, there may be other tokens we could consider stopwords that weren't removed. "
